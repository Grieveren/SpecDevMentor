# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the systematic approach to fix the CodeMentor AI platform codebase, transforming it from a state with multiple TypeScript compilation errors, build failures, and test issues into a fully functional production-ready system that runs locally. The current codebase has a 5% success rate in comprehensive validation tests, with 15 out of 17 critical tests failing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TypeScript Compilation Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved so that the codebase can build successfully without any type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm type-check` THEN the system SHALL complete without any TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN running `pnpm type-check:client` THEN the client SHALL compile successfully with zero errors
3. WHEN running `pnpm type-check:server` THEN the server SHALL compile successfully with zero errors
4. WHEN running incremental TypeScript compilation THEN the system SHALL complete in under 30 seconds
5. IF strict mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL compile without warnings or errors

### Requirement 2: Build Process Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build processes to work correctly so that I can generate production-ready artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm build:client` THEN the system SHALL generate client build artifacts in `client/dist/`
2. WHEN running `pnpm build:server` THEN the system SHALL generate server build artifacts in `server/dist/`
3. WHEN running `pnpm build` THEN both client and server SHALL build successfully
4. WHEN build artifacts are generated THEN they SHALL be valid and executable
5. IF build process fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with actionable guidance

### Requirement 3: Test Suite Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test suites to execute successfully so that I can verify code functionality and maintain quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm test` THEN all test suites SHALL execute without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN running client tests THEN they SHALL complete with at least 80% pass rate
3. WHEN running server tests THEN they SHALL complete with at least 80% pass rate
4. WHEN generating test coverage THEN the system SHALL produce coverage reports
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information

### Requirement 4: Development Server Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both client and server development servers to start and run properly so that I can develop and test the application locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm dev` THEN both client and server development servers SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN client dev server starts THEN it SHALL be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`
3. WHEN server dev server starts THEN it SHALL be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`
4. WHEN making changes to code THEN hot module replacement SHALL work correctly
5. IF development servers fail to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Linting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code quality tools to work properly so that I can maintain consistent code standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm lint` THEN ESLint SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN running `pnpm format:check` THEN Prettier SHALL validate formatting without errors
3. WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL execute successfully
4. WHEN fixing linting issues THEN `pnpm lint:fix` SHALL resolve auto-fixable problems
5. IF code quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for fixes

### Requirement 6: Database and External Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all database connections and external dependencies to work correctly so that the application can function with full feature set.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN database connections SHALL be established successfully
2. WHEN running database migrations THEN they SHALL complete without errors
3. WHEN seeding the database THEN sample data SHALL be inserted correctly
4. WHEN connecting to Redis THEN the connection SHALL be established and functional
5. IF external dependencies are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 7: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment configuration to be properly set up so that the application can run in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the environment THEN all required environment variables SHALL be documented and validated
2. WHEN running in development mode THEN appropriate development configurations SHALL be applied
3. WHEN running in production mode THEN production-optimized settings SHALL be used
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive errors

### Requirement 8: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be production-ready so that it can be deployed and used by end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the production build THEN all assets SHALL be optimized and minified
2. WHEN starting the production server THEN it SHALL serve the application correctly
3. WHEN load testing the application THEN it SHALL handle expected user loads
4. WHEN monitoring the application THEN health checks SHALL report system status accurately
5. IF production deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation so that I can understand, maintain, and extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all major components SHALL have clear documentation
2. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN setup instructions SHALL be accurate and complete
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN troubleshooting guides SHALL provide actionable solutions
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL be able to get the system running within 30 minutes
5. IF documentation is outdated THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect current implementation

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and monitoring so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail and context
2. WHEN the system encounters failures THEN it SHALL fail gracefully with user-friendly messages
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN key metrics SHALL be tracked and reported
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN appropriate alerts SHALL be triggered
5. IF the system becomes unhealthy THEN automatic recovery mechanisms SHALL attempt to restore functionality
