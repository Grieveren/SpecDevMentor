## Success Criteria

Each task includes specific validation steps to ensure progress:

- **Foundation Phase**: TypeScript configurations are valid, dependencies install cleanly
- **Compilation Phase**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors across entire codebase
- **Build Phase**: Both client and server build successfully with valid artifacts
- **Testing Phase**: All test suites execute with >95% pass rate
- **Development Phase**: Both dev servers start and work correctly
- **Integration Phase**: Full application functionality works end-to-end
- **Production Phase**: System is optimized and ready for production deployment
- **Final Validation**: 100% success rate on comprehensive validation suite (17/17 tests passing)

## Execution Strategy

1. **Sequential Execution**: Tasks must be completed in order due to dependencies
2. **Incremental Validation**: Validate progress after each major task completion
3. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to rollback if issues are introduced
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as changes are made
5. **Testing**: Test thoroughly at each phase to prevent regression

This implementation plan provides a systematic path from the current 5% validation success rate to a fully functional, production-ready system.
