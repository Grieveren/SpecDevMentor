# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CodeMentor-AI is a comprehensive specification-based development learning platform designed to teach developers the complete workflow of spec-driven development methodology. The platform combines AI-powered guidance, interactive lessons, collaborative tools, and hands-on exercises to provide practical experience with specification-based development from requirements gathering through implementation. The system aims to improve software development quality and team collaboration by teaching structured approaches to project planning and execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Specification Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to follow a structured specification workflow (Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation), so that I can learn and apply systematic development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL initialize a specification workflow with Requirements, Design, Tasks, and Implementation phases
2. WHEN a user completes a phase THEN the system SHALL require explicit approval before proceeding to the next phase
3. WHEN a user is in a specific phase THEN the system SHALL provide phase-appropriate tools and guidance
4. IF a user attempts to skip a phase THEN the system SHALL prevent progression and display validation messages
5. WHEN a user navigates between phases THEN the system SHALL maintain workflow state and display current progress

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Specification Review

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered analysis of my specification documents, so that I can improve the quality and completeness of my requirements, design, and task documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests specification review THEN the system SHALL analyze the document for quality, completeness, and best practices
2. WHEN the AI identifies issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable feedback with suggested improvements
3. WHEN a user applies AI suggestions THEN the system SHALL track changes and allow rollback if needed
4. IF a specification document is incomplete THEN the system SHALL identify missing sections and recommend additions
5. WHEN reviewing requirements THEN the system SHALL validate EARS format compliance and user story structure

### Requirement 3: Interactive Learning Curriculum

**User Story:** As a developer learning specification-based development, I want structured lessons and hands-on exercises, so that I can master the methodology through practical application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the learning curriculum THEN the system SHALL present lessons organized by specification methodology topics
2. WHEN a user completes a lesson THEN the system SHALL track progress and unlock subsequent lessons
3. WHEN a user engages with hands-on exercises THEN the system SHALL provide realistic specification scenarios with guided practice
4. IF a user struggles with a concept THEN the system SHALL offer additional resources and alternative explanations
5. WHEN a user completes exercises THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on methodology application and best practices

### Requirement 4: Real-time Collaborative Development

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate on specification documents in real-time with my colleagues, so that we can work together effectively on project planning and design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users edit the same specification document THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes in real-time
2. WHEN conflicting edits occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms
3. WHEN a user makes changes THEN the system SHALL display author attribution and timestamps
4. IF a user loses connection THEN the system SHALL preserve their changes and sync when reconnected
5. WHEN team members review documents THEN the system SHALL support structured approval workflows with comments and suggestions

### Requirement 5: Code Execution and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute code within the platform and validate implementations against specifications, so that I can verify that my code meets the documented requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits code for execution THEN the system SHALL run the code in a secure, isolated environment
2. WHEN code execution completes THEN the system SHALL display results, output, and any errors
3. WHEN validating against specifications THEN the system SHALL check implementation compliance with documented requirements
4. IF code fails validation THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback on specification mismatches
5. WHEN code passes validation THEN the system SHALL update task completion status and provide confirmation

### Requirement 6: Template Library and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to specification templates and best practice examples, so that I can create high-quality documentation efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates new specification documents THEN the system SHALL offer relevant templates based on project type
2. WHEN a user browses templates THEN the system SHALL categorize them by methodology phase and project domain
3. WHEN a user applies a template THEN the system SHALL populate the document with structured sections and example content
4. IF a user customizes templates THEN the system SHALL allow saving custom templates for team reuse
5. WHEN viewing templates THEN the system SHALL provide explanations of best practices and usage guidelines

### Requirement 7: Progress Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to track team progress on specification methodology adoption and project effectiveness, so that I can measure improvement and identify areas needing support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team members use the platform THEN the system SHALL track specification creation, review cycles, and completion rates
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on methodology adoption, time-to-completion, and quality metrics
3. WHEN viewing team progress THEN the system SHALL display individual and team-level skill development over time
4. IF teams show declining performance THEN the system SHALL identify patterns and suggest interventions
5. WHEN measuring business impact THEN the system SHALL correlate specification quality with project success metrics

### Requirement 8: User Authentication and Project Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want secure authentication and organized project management, so that I can access my work and collaborate with appropriate team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure account with email verification
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and establish a secure session
3. WHEN a user creates projects THEN the system SHALL organize them with proper access controls and team permissions
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log security events
5. WHEN managing team access THEN the system SHALL support role-based permissions for different collaboration levels
