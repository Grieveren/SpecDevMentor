# Authentication Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The user is unable to sign up because the development server is running a simplified version (`index-simple.ts`) that lacks the complete authentication system. The full authentication routes exist but are not being used by the currently running server instance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Server Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development server to use the complete authentication system, so that users can register and login properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL use the full `index.ts` file with complete authentication routes
2. WHEN a user makes a POST request to `/api/auth/register` THEN the system SHALL respond with proper registration handling
3. WHEN a user makes a POST request to `/api/auth/login` THEN the system SHALL respond with proper login handling
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL initialize Redis connection for session management
5. WHEN authentication routes are accessed THEN they SHALL include proper validation and error handling

### Requirement 2: Complete Registration Endpoint

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with my name, email, and password, so that I can access the CodeMentor AI platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account
2. WHEN a user submits an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return a conflict error
3. WHEN a user submits invalid password format THEN the system SHALL return validation errors
4. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return user data and authentication tokens
5. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3: Authentication Service Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication service to be properly integrated with Redis and database, so that user sessions are managed securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL connect to Redis for session management
2. WHEN a user registers THEN their password SHALL be properly hashed using bcrypt
3. WHEN authentication tokens are generated THEN they SHALL be stored in Redis
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 4: Development Environment Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development environment to run the correct server configuration, so that all features work as expected during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm dev` THEN the system SHALL start the full server with all routes
2. WHEN the development server restarts THEN it SHALL maintain the correct configuration
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log which endpoints are available
5. WHEN there are startup errors THEN they SHALL be clearly displayed to the developer
