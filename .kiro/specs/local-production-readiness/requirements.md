# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements to transform the CodeMentor AI platform from its current state (5% validation success rate with 15 out of 17 tests failing) into a fully functional, production-ready system that can run locally for comprehensive UAT testing and eventual production deployment. The platform is an AI-powered specification-based development learning platform with React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis caching.
