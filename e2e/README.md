## Test Results

Test results are generated in the `test-results/` directory:

- **HTML Reports**: Interactive test reports with screenshots and videos
- **JSON Results**: Machine-readable test results
- **Screenshots**: Captured on test failures
- **Videos**: Recorded for failed tests
- **Traces**: Detailed execution traces for debugging

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Use Page Object Pattern**: Utilize the helper classes in `fixtures/`
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and clean up after itself
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive test names that explain the scenario
4. **Proper Assertions**: Use appropriate Playwright assertions for better error messages
5. **Error Handling**: Test both success and failure scenarios

### Test Data Management

1. **Use Test Fixtures**: Leverage the predefined test users and projects
2. **Clean State**: Ensure tests start with a clean state
3. **Realistic Data**: Use realistic test data that matches production scenarios

### Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel Execution**: Most tests run in parallel for faster execution
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Always clean up resources after tests
3. **Timeout Configuration**: Set appropriate timeouts for different test types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services Not Running**: Ensure both client (port 5173) and server (port 3001) are running
2. **Browser Installation**: Run `npx playwright install` if browsers are missing
3. **Port Conflicts**: Check for conflicting processes on required ports
4. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout values for slower environments

### Debug Tips

1. **Use UI Mode**: Run tests with `--ui` flag for interactive debugging
2. **Screenshots**: Check `test-results/` for failure screenshots
3. **Console Logs**: Enable browser console logs in test configuration
4. **Trace Viewer**: Use Playwright trace viewer for detailed debugging

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite is designed to work in CI/CD environments:

1. **Headless Mode**: Tests run in headless mode by default
2. **Parallel Execution**: Configurable worker count for CI environments
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for flaky tests
4. **Multiple Reporters**: JSON and JUnit reporters for CI integration

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and patterns
2. Add appropriate test tags (`@accessibility`, `@security`, etc.)
3. Update this README if adding new test categories
4. Ensure tests are deterministic and don't rely on external services
5. Add proper error handling and cleanup

## Security Considerations

- Test credentials are for testing only and should not be used in production
- Security tests validate protection mechanisms but don't perform actual attacks
- Sensitive test data should be properly sanitized
- Test results may contain sensitive information and should be handled appropriately
